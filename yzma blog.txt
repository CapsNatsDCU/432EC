First of all, let’s get one thing straight: I practically ran the empire. I attended every council, handled every decree, and kept that spoiled little brat Kuzco alive long enough to reach adulthood. And what thanks do I get? He fires me! Fired! After decades of service, tossed out like yesterday’s bathwater. Honestly, without me, the boy couldn’t organize his own sandals.

Naturally, I decided that if he was going to betray me, then it was time for… alternative management strategies. Nothing drastic, of course—just a touch of poison at dinner. Elegant, subtle, practically a mercy. But nooooo, Kronk had to ruin it. Instead of poison, Kuzco gets the llama potion. A llama! Do you know how hard it is to stage a dignified coup when the intended victim is spitting grass and humming at butterflies?

Still, I adapted. That’s the mark of true leadership. My plan was simple: keep Kuzco a llama forever, and presto, I’m Empress. But Kronk, bless his pea-sized brain, got sentimental. He couldn’t even finish the job of disposing of Kuzco. “I couldn’t do it, Yzma, he’s got those big sad llama eyes…” Ugh! Sometimes I wonder if Kronk is my assistant or my babysitter.

So then it was off on a ridiculous chase across the countryside. And let me tell you, the countryside is filthy. Mud, bugs, villagers with opinions. I had to ride a rickety old cart, sleep in the wilderness, and worst of all—eat food that wasn’t prepared by palace chefs. Do you know what I had for dinner one night? Squirrel. Actual squirrel! Kronk thought it was “delicious” and “full of protein.” I thought it tasted like a leather shoe that had been marinated in regret.

Meanwhile, Kuzco and that peasant, Pacha, were bumbling around like they were the heroes of the story. Heroes! Please. All they did was trip over cliffs, argue about hammocks, and somehow avoid falling into my perfectly reasonable death traps. I ask you, who builds a rope bridge that collapses at the slightest sneeze? And why, oh why, did I have to cross it while Kronk sang his own theme music?

And don’t even get me started on the chase to the palace. We were running, climbing, jumping off rooftops—honestly, I’m too fabulous for cardio. And when we finally got to the lab, Kronk forgot which lever to pull. How hard is it to remember: “Pull the lever, Kronk!” WRONG LEVER! I still have nightmares about falling into crocodile pits. Do you know how much spa time it takes to recover from that sort of stress?

In the end, I was foiled. Foiled! By a talking llama and a villager with a poncho. Oh, and let’s not forget Kronk, who ended up joining a scout troop instead of helping me take over an empire. Really, if anyone deserved to be Empress, it was me. Style, vision, charisma—what more could the people want?

So yes, I lost. But remember this: history is written by the victors, and Kuzco is too busy dancing to ever write anything. One day, when the people are tired of his parties and llama statues, they’ll remember me—Yzma, the greatest ruler they never had.

Until then, I’ll be over here, working on new potions. Who knows—maybe next time I’ll turn him into something useful. Like a doormat.
